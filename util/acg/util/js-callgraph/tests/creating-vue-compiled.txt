The steps to making the vue-compiled directory were:

1. copy the entire vue directory to a fold called vue-compiled
2. Run this script in the directory above it

	for f in $(find ./vue-compiled -name '*.js'); 
	do 
	  $(babel --presets flow $f > $f.o)
	  echo $f

	done

This traverses the directories and runs babel on each of the files and saves their compiled output to a .js.o file with the same name and location.
